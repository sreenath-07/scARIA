Each value in the matrix represents the number of Tn5 integration sites for each single barcode (i.e. a cell) that map within each peak.

We calculate this per single cell, and quantify the approximate ratio of mononucleosomal to nucleosome-free fragments (stored as `nucleosome_signal`)\n",

The [ENCODE project](https://www.encodeproject.org/) has defined an ATAC-seq targeting score based on the ratio of fragments centered at the TSS to fragments in TSS-flanking regions (see https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/). Poor ATAC-seq experiments typically will have a low TSS enrichment score. We can compute this metric for each cell with the `TSSEnrichment()` function, and the results are stored in metadata under the column name `TSS.enrichment`.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Fraction of fragments in peaks: Represents the fraction of all fragments that fall within ATAC-seq peaks. Cells with low values (i.e. <15-20%) often represent low-quality cells or technical artifacts that should be removed. Note that this value can be sensitive to the set of peaks used.\n",

Cells with a high proportion of reads mapping to these areas (compared to reads mapping to peaks) often represent technical artifacts and should be removed.
